# PROMUEVA

This repository is part of the PROMUEVA project, which aims to understand and counter political polarization in social media, using computational models. Specifically, this project contains multiple Maude implementations of computational models of polarization, from different articles found in the related literature. Each one of the folders in this repository should be treated as a self-contained project.


## [Model1: Persuasive Argument Communication in Teams with Strong Faultlines](https://github.com/dfosorio/PROMUEVA/tree/main/Model1)

Demographic and cultural diversity is on the rise in many organizations, and this poses challenges and opportunities for team performance. As workgroups become more diverse, it is crucial to understand how diversity affects team cohesion and effectiveness. While diversity can be an important asset for team performance, it has also been described as a double-edged sword, as it can generate conflict and tension within the group. The authors in the [cited article](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10588-020-09315-8) seek to computationally model how diversity in teams, which is represented as demographic faultlines, affects the opinion of team participants. For this analysis, in addition to demographic faultlines, two social phenomena, which are homophily and persuasive argumment communcation, are taken into account.
